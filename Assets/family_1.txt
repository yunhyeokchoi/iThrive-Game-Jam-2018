[ Mom picked up a phone. ]
I was looking forward your phone call!
Thanks for calling my dear!
How's it going?
Is everything going ok?
Yes, yes. I understand.
I know it's hard sometimes.
Think of it as an investment for your future.
I know you'll make it eventually!
Call me sometimes.
It's good to hear your voice again!
