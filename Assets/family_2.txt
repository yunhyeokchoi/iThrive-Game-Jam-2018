[ Dad picked up a phone. ]
Who's this again?
Oh, hahahaha!
I wasn't expecting it at all!
Yes, yes. Dad is doing just fine.
What about you? How's your school?
Don't worry too much about it.
Time flies, you know.
It'll all be over in the blink of an eye.
You'd forget about it like it never happened.
Do whatever you want and try different things.
-and don't forget to stay healthy!
It was good talking to you!
