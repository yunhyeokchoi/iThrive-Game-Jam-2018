[ Grandma picked up a phone. ]
... Hello?
Who is this again? I can't hear too well.
Oh my dear! So good to hear your voice again!
How's your school my dear?
Have you made friends yet?
Granny's just as usual.
I don't feel too good these days.
-and I keep forgetting things.
-but, I try to write and read everyday you know.
It was really nice talking to you.
Hope I can see you seen.
Eat well, and stay healthy my dear.
